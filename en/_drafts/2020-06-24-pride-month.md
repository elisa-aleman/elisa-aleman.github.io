Did you know June is the LGBT Pride month? To me it is general knowledge, but to many in the workplace, it might not be. In today's entry I'll speak about the basics of queer vocabulary, why it's an important month for us, and what companies and academic places can do to make their workplace a better place for everyone.

Of course, many people know since it has become a common theme in the news, but not all countries have this, and living in Japan, it is only talked about within queer circles and still carries a lot of stigma. 

First let me start with the title. Lot's of people know about LGBT, however, not everyone knows what it means, or how many letters we should use, etc.

Below I list the ones I used up to now: 

- **LGBT+**: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and other queer identities and sexual minorities
- **GSRM**: Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities
- **queer**: An umbrella term encompassing all gender, sexual and romantic minorities, and sometimes used in defiance to being classified as one or the other for either case.

It's important to add the + in LGBT+ because lots of identities aren't represented in the abbreviations we used before. Some people used LGBTQ, LGBTQI, even as far as LGBTQIA2s... but none of them really span the whole spectrum of queerness, and someone gets left behind at some point. Which is why the + includes everyone under the name that everyone is familiar with.

However, that gives more representation to some than others, so the acronym GSRM got made, which includes all the different representations without putting anyone first... but it is also very little known by people so sometimes it's not recognizable. When we want to make our point across, it's important that everybody knows what we mean, so not many people use it.

Now, even before I finish writing my post I want to make sure: if anyone wants to ask questions, if anyone feels like they don't understand, feel free to ask me questions through my contact info.

### The Pride Flag üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

The pride flag is representing all of the queer community, the rainbow being a symbol for it since 1978. However, in the past it was used as specifically the homosexual flag as opposed to other identities with their own flags. There is already a separate Lesbian flag, so sometimes it's perceived as only the gay men flag. Recently however, there has been proposals of a flag only for men who are attracted to men, so that the Rainbow flag can stay as a representation of ***all*** queer people.

<a id="the-s-in-gsrm-sexual-orientation"></a>
### The S in GSRM: Sexual orientation

First let's define sexual orientation. There are different types of attraction that we experience, such as sexual, romantic, platonic, aesthetic, etc. Sexual orientation is specifically about which people one is sexually attracted and how that relates to one's own gender. More simply said, it's who you like that way. It's important to make a distinction here because there are many combinations depending on which type of attraction a person experiences.

Remember:

- You can like one gender
- You can like two
- You can like more
- You can like none

And this is all ok.

            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

__Heterosexuality__

Heterosexuality is when men are attracted to women, or when women are attracted to men. It is usually seen as the default, but it is only one of the many sexualities there are. LGBT and queer pride doesn't include this identity as part of the community because of this, but I mention it here to explain that we should use this terminology instead of words like "normal", since this implies that LGBT people aren't normal.


__Homosexuality__

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="img_flag"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/LGBT_flag_square.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

The L and the G in LGBT, Lesbian and Gay are terms for when someone are sexually attracted to people of the same sex. Gay is predominantly used to mean gay men, but some women also use the word gay to describe themselves.

___Gay men___

As I mentioned before, a flag specifically for gay men has been created recently so that the rainbow flag can encompass everyone. 

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="img_flag"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/New_Gay_Pride_Flag.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

___Lesbian people___

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="img_flag"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/Lesbian_flag_Orange_and_Pink_.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

This is the word we use when women are attracted to women. This is the new flag, since the person that made the previous one said bad things about trans people, so sometimes you might run into a different one. Some people also use this flag to mean "Non-men who are attracted to other people that aren't men". Depending on how people express their gender, they might or not use this label for them. It really depends on who you ask, and people use these flags differently.


__Bisexuality__

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="img_flag"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/Bisexual_Pride_Flag.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Bisexual is the word used for people who are attracted to two or more genders. I say two or more because in reality people can be attracted to different genders in the spectrum of identities that people can have. Sometimes Bisexuality might encompass all people, but with different preferences or tastes for each gender, or perhaps a tendency to like one gender more often than the other. It really is up to the person to define themselves and think about who they are attracted to. Some people actually write it as Bi+ since it includes more than two. 


__Asexuality__

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="img_flag"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/Asexual_Pride_Flag.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Asexuality is a sexual orientation in which people don't have any sexual attraction for any genders. It is also an umbrella term including Demisexuality or Gray-Asexual people, who experience some attraction, but it is rare or in very specific conditions, such that they relate to the Asexuality umbrella in some way. We will talk about these identities more in [The R in GSRM: Romantic orientation](#the-r-in-gsrm-romantic-orientation).


__Pansexuality__

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="img_flag"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/Pansexuality_Pride_Flag.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Pansexuality is the word used to describe people who are attracted to people, regardless of their gender. It is said that the difference with Bisexuality is that it is not conditional, and that pansexual people might not even think of the gender of people before considering them attractive. However, this distinction is personal, and of course, people can have preferences and tastes about who they like. In the end, it's up to the person to find the identity that best suits them and feels right.

<a id="the-r-in-gsrm-romantic-orientation"></a>
### The R in GSRM: Romantic orientation

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="art_img_landscape"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/romantic_orientation.png" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

This part doesn't have as many specific flags as the rest, but it deserves explanation.

As I mentioned in the beginning, there are several types of attraction. One of these is the romantic attraction, which is less about sexual desire and more about who one loves or wants to spend romantic time with. 

Most of the time, people have the same sexual and romantic orientations. That is, if someone says ‚ÄúI like girls‚Äù, they might mean they like them sexually and also romantically fall in love with them. But in reality, these two can be different.


For example:
- An asexual person could not like any genders sexually but they could fall in love with people of a specific gender, or of any gender, if they are so inclined.
- Another example is someone who likes the opposite sex sexually (Heterosexual), but that romantically they only fall in love with the same sex.

There are many examples:

- __Heteroromantic__, likes the opposite gender romantically
- __Homoromantic__, likes the same gender romantically
- __Biromantic__, likes both or other genders romantically
- __Panromantic__, likes people romantically regardless of their gender
- __Aromantic__, doesn't like any people romantically.


<a id="the-g-in-gsrm-gender-identity"></a>
### The G in GSRM: Gender identity

Gender identity is unrelated to who you are attracted to, and instead it's about who you are. One can be ***cisgender***, which means that one's identity matches what one was assigned at birth, or ***transgender***, which is when your identity doesn't match the one assigned to you at birth. 

Now, we also have to make a distinction about **sex** and **gender**. 

- Sex: It is defined as the biological differences in the anatomical sense, primary and secondary sex characteristics, and reproductive organs.
- Gender: It is the psychological and social aspect of sex. It is an internal awareness of one's identity regarding sex. It also encompasses sex-based social structures and assigned or taken roles.

Now! Neither of these are binary! People are really diverse, and that is both in identity and biology. You can see in this simplified graph just how varied we are.

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="art_img_landscape"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/sex_gender_not_binary.png" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

They're also not fully independent from each other! For example, psychological gender might be related to biological hormones and neurological structure and neuro chemicals that are hard to separate from sexual characteristics.

Gender identity is about what gender ***you*** feel like inside and want to live like. 

- You can be a woman
- You can be a man
- You can be in between
- You can be none
- You can be both

With that in mind, let's see the vocabulary for this:

__Transgender__

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="img_flag"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/Transgender_Pride_Flag.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


Transgender is an umbrella term, which means there can be other identities that belong to this category, and still be different from other people in the transgender community. Since transgender people have the neurological structure and chemicals, and depending on treatment, hormones as well, it can't be said that they have one sex and the opposite gender. In reality it is much more complex than that and it is an invalidating phrase that we should avoid repeating.


__Non-binary__

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="img_flag"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/Non-binary_enby_pride_flag.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Non-binary people are transgender people who identify neither as a man or a woman, but something in between or something completely different. In Japan it's sometimes known as X-Gender. 


__Agender__

<div class="art-gallery-container">
    <div class="art-gallery">
        <div class="art-div">
            <img
            class="img_flag"
            src="/assets/lgbt_flags/Agender_Pride_Flag.svg#svgView(preserveAspectRatio(none))" 
            alt="" 
            />
        </div>
    </div>
</div>


Agender people don't identify with any gender whatsoever, not even the non-binary ones. In Japan, I believe I've seen it described as

### Diversity is not an exam

Did everyone learn anything new?
It's not important to remember all the flags, but to live in harmony and recognize that there's many kinds of people, but that we are all humans. Let's all walk into this world full of diversity together!

There are many combinations that can happen with gender identity, sexual orientation and romantic orientation,
and I really wanted to show you how diverse people can be.
If you have any questions beyond this please feel free to ask.

## Why is June the Pride Month? Stonewall Riots

So, let's talk about why June is the Pride month. In June 28th, 1969, there was something called the Stonewall riots, and that's why Pride is done on June.

At that time, there was a very strong anti-gay climate in USA. LGBT people would be discriminated, banned from shops, and so on. Actually they had no place to go but illegal bars owned by the mafia, which welcomed the people that had nowhere else to go. A bar called Stonewall Inn owned by the mafia was one of those places, and LGBT people would gather there. But there were many raids and arrests by police to those places. Innocent LGBT people would get crushed on the ground and arrested or killed for no other reason than being LGBT. So there was a reaction.

A black trans woman threw the first brick, and so the riot started.

To make things simple, the riots went on and then they ended, but as a result, at last were LGBT rights starting to appear.

So what I want everyone to reflect this month is how our human rights have always come from people's deaths and sacrifice.

<a id="what-does-this-have-to-do-with-corporate-environment"></a>
## What does this have to do with corporate environment?

Diversity and Inclusion might seem like something that has no relation to the workplace or academic settings, but indeed, people who live within these minorities have no way of separating this part of themselves in a society that expects assimilation with the status quo. Depending on where we live, there's definitely rights that we don't have compared to other people. I want to talk specifically about Japan. In Japan it's not in any way legally defined that queer people can't be discriminated. This means that, completely legally, people can lose their jobs, be denied housing, and therefore have a very hard time living here in Japan. The pressure to stay hidden therefore is there for many... and sometimes it is too much for people. There's a lot of homeless queer people, or people who lost everything once their families became estranged from rejection. Depending on the age that this estrangement happens, sometimes that means minors would need approval signatures from parents when they refuse to help for, say, housing. 

In hospitals, perhaps a person is denied visitation because of not being technically family of their loved one. Transgender people in particular,
