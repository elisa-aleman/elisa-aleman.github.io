Did you know June is the LGBT Pride month? To me it is general knowledge, but to many in the workplace, it might not be. In today's entry I'll speak about the basics of queer vocabulary, why it's an important month for us, and what companies and academic places can do to make their workplace a better place for everyone.

Of course, many people know since it has become a common theme in the news, but not all countries have this, and living in Japan, it is only talked about within queer circles and still carries a lot of stigma. 

First let me start with the title. Lot's of people know about LGBT, however, not everyone knows what it means, or how many letters we should use, etc.

Below I list the ones I used up to now: 

- **LGBT+**: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and other queer identities and sexual minorities
- **GSRM**: Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities
- **queer**: An umbrella term encompassing all gender, sexual and romantic minorities, and sometimes used in defiance to being classified as one or the other for either case.

It's important to add the + in LGBT+ because lots of identities aren't represented in the abbreviations we used before. Some people used LGBTQ, LGBTQI, even as far as LGBTQIA2s... but none of them really span the whole spectrum of queerness, and someone gets left behind at some point. Which is why the + includes everyone under the name that everyone is familiar with.

However, that gives more representation to some than others, so the acronym GSRM got made, which includes all the different representations without putting anyone first... but it is also very little known by people so sometimes it's not recognizable. When we want to make our point across, it's important that everybody knows what we mean, so not many people use it.

Now, even before I finish writing my post I want to make sure: if anyone wants to ask questions, if anyone feels like they don't understand, feel free to ask me questions through my contact info.

### The Pride Flag üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

The flag is the same as the flag for all queer people, but previously, and depending on the person, it is used as the homosexual flag. There is already a separate Lesbian flag, so sometimes it's perceived as only the gay men flag. Recently however, there has been proposals of a flag only for men who are attracted to men, so that the Rainbow flag can stay as a representation of ***all*** queer people.

### The S in GSRM: Sexual orientation

First let's define sexual orientation. There are different types of attraction that we experience.

__Homosexuality (Gay)__

The L and the G in LGBT, Lesbian and Gay is when you are attracted to people of the same sex. Gay is predominantly used to mean gay men, but some women also use the word gay to describe themselves.


__Lesbian__

This is the word we use when women are attracted to women. This is the new flag, since the person that made the previous one said bad things about trans people. Some people also use this flag to mean "Liking other people that aren't men". It really depends on who you ask, and people use these flags differently.

Ôøº ÔºöBisexuality, when you like two or more genders, and this is its flag.

Ôøº ÔºöAsexuality, when you don't have any sexual preference for any genders, and its flag.

Ôøº ÔºöPansexual, when you like a person regardless of their gender, and its flag.


<a id="the-g-in-gsrm-gender-identity"></a>
### The G in GSRM: Gender identity

ÔøºÔºöTransgender, when you identify as a gender that wasn't the one assigned to you at birth, and its flag.

ÔøºÔºöNon-binary, when you identify neither as a man or a woman, but something in between or something completely different, this is its flag.

Ôøº ÔºöAgender, when you don't identify with any gender whatsoever, not even the non-binary ones. This is its flag.


<a id="the-r-in-gsrm-romantic-orientation"></a>
### The R in GSRM: Romantic orientation

This part doesn't have as many specific flags as the rest, but it deserves explanation.

Most of the time, people have the same sexual and romantic orientations. That is, if someone says ‚ÄúI like girls‚Äù, they might mean they like them sexually and also romantically fall in love with them. But in reality, these two can be different.
For example:
    An asexual person Ôøº could not like any genders sexually but they could fall in love with people of a specific gender, or of any gender, if they are so inclined.
    Another example is someone who likes the opposite sex sexually (Heterosexual), but that romantically they only fall in love with the same sex Ôøº
There are many examples
Heteroromantic, likes the opposite gender romantically
Homoromantic, likes the same gender romantically
Biromantic, likes both or other genders romantically
Panromantic, likes people romantically regardless of their gender
Aromantic, doesn't like any people romantically.

Did everyone learn anything new?
It's not important to remember all the flags, but to live in harmony and recognize that there's many kinds of people, but that we are all humans. Let's all walk into this world full of diversity together!

There are many combinations that can happen with gender identity, sexual orientation and romantic orientation,
and I really wanted to show you how diverse people can be.
If you have any questions beyond this please feel free to ask.

## Why is June the Pride Month?

So, let's talk about why June is the Pride month Ôøº .

I'm sure you all know by now, but there's protests and riots happening in USA because of the discrimination of black people and the murder of a black man, George Floyd, by the police during an arrest.

So, actually in June 28 1969, there was something called the Stonewall riots, and that's why Pride is done on June.

At that time, there was a very strong anti-gay climate in USA. LGBT people would be discriminated, banned from shops, and so on. Actually they had no place to go but illegal bars owned by the mafia, which welcomed the people that had nowhere else to go. A bar called Stonewall Inn owned by the mafia was one of those places, and LGBT people would gather there. But there were many raids and arrests by police to those places. Innocent LGBT people would get crushed on the ground and arrested or killed for no other reason than being LGBT. So there was a reaction.

A black trans woman threw the first brick, and so the riot started.

Lots of things happened, and the riot ended, but as a result, at last were LGBT rights starting to appear.

So what I want everyone to reflect this month is how our human rights have always come from people's deaths and sacrifice.
