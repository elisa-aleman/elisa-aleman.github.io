## Introduction

I am an AI engineer born in Mexico, I have lived in Japan for over 7 years and have gotten used to Japanese language and culture. I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees and have a PhD in Information Science and Control Engineering, which I obtained in the Nagaoka University of Technology, Nagaoka, Japan under the instruction of Hirofumi Nonaka. I delve in Artificial Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Mining. My engineering interests are Text and Data mining for management purposes and multilingual endeavors.

### Club and Circle Activities

I was the club leader of the Aikido club in my university, but there hasn't been any recent activity due to the pandemic. Not so much recently because of the pandemic, but since I was an undergraduate, I wanted to experience various martial arts, so I also participated in the karate club, judo club, kendo club, archery club, and Shorinji Kempo club. When I was in third year of undergraduate school, I also belonged to music circles and art circles, and even performed live at some points.

After leaving school I continue to practice martial arts and athleticism along with visual art in my free time.

			Since Nagaoka University of Technology became an SDGs hub university and started recruiting student promoters, I applied because I saw it as an opportunity to cooperate with more people in making the progress I wanted to see in this school. Recently, I've been designing posters and presentations for promotion of events related to SDGs. Most recently, I organized an online lecture presentation on LGBT and gender, sexual and romantic minorities, and the problems queer people are facing in societies around the world, especially in Japan. I presented this lecture was during the Transgender Awareness Week 2020, both in Japanese and English. <a href="https://elisa-aleman.github.io/assets/publications/PDFs/2020-11-16_LGBT_presentation.pdf"> You can see the slides here</a>. Previously, I also designed a poster for a cleaning event to pick up trash on the beach and also participated in said event. I recently edited an interview video to promote awareness of the situation of refugees. <a href="https://www.nagaokaut.ac.jp/annai/daigakusyokai/sdgs/senryaku.html"> Details of other activities can be found at this link </a>.
