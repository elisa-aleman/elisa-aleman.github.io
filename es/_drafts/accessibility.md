¡Hola a todes! Hoy quería hablar sobre la accesibilidad tanto digital como física en el lugar de trabajo. ¿Te has detenido a preguntarte cómo otras personas navegan el mundo?

## Qué es la accesibilidad?

Primero que nada quiero explicar en caso de que sea algo nuevo para alguien, la accesibilidad es el grado al que una cosa o lugar está disponible para el uso de tanta gente como sea posible. Más que todo se menciona en casos de discapacidad, pero no es necesariamente el único caso en el que aplica.

Por dar un ejemplo fácil de entender de la accesibilidad, imagínate una rampa para la gente que no puede usar las escaleras. Fíjate como no dije "personas en sillas de ruedas". La accesibilidad no es exclusiva para un solo caso. Digamos que hay alguien que tuvo una lesión en la pierna pero todavía puede caminar con cierto apoyo. O quizás imaginemos a alguien que tiene uso completo de sus piernas, pero resulta que en ese momento estaba exhausto. Esas personas también se benefician de la rampa. Muchas personas se pueden beneficiar de espacios accesibles, pero las personas que más lo necesitan son las que más lastima que no haya las acomodaciones apropiadas. Piensa, ¿cuántos lugares has ido que no tienen este tipo de acomodaciones, y cómo afecta esto a la gente?

Hay de todo tipo de accesibilidad. Más específicamente, puede ser física, como las rampas, elevadores, marcas en el suelo para guiar a la gente ciega, rieles de soporte, etc. Puede ser comunicativa, como acceso multilingüe, señales universales, o subtítulos en un video. En esta ultima también quiero decir que la accesibilidad digital también es importante, y usualmente se manifesta en maneras que no muchos piensan.

## Invisible disabilities

In general, it's usually the case that people don't consider disabilities they can't see. Within the disabled community I've seen cases where even when someone is using a wheelchair, if they stand up and display the ability to use their legs, are accused of being lazy or fake. We have to understand that different people have different needs. It could be that they can only stand up for short periods of time, or that they are not fully recovered from a debilitating injury, and we will never know. People who have hearing issues or chronic fatigue are often not discernible at first sight either. People who are color blind, also, are usually invisible to others.

Personally, I also suffer from invisible disadvantages that make me need accommodations. Because of my ADHD, it's hard for me to focus on sounds or people's voices and fully understand something without fail. I don't have any hearing loss, but rather have audio processing issues. So I still need subtitles in videos even in my own language and prefer quiet places when having conversations so that I can fully concentrate on what people say. I also have knee problems from an injury I had when I was in high school, but when I complain about stairs, people often seem to think I just need more exercise. Meanwhile, I exercise daily, strength train and am very adept at several martial arts. I often get by without issue but it doesn't diminish the fact that these things are not always accessible in spaces that I visit, or the videos that I watch. I am also sensitive to loud noises and bright lights, so I often am uncomfortable in places with too many stimuli.

## Everyone will be disabled one day

Now, you might be thinking, "well this doesn't have anything to do with me, I'm fully able!". I wouldn't blame you for thinking that you're able, although not caring about others is probably not good. However, something many people fail to realize is that we are all aging creatures. Time, inevitably, will leave us with some sort of disability or other. It could be pain, disease, or perhaps even an accident. Everyone can become disabled from one day to the next, and it's our responsibility to make the world accessible to all of us, or we will suffer next.

## Digital Accessibility

Have you considered the digital world also needs accessibility accommodations? Blind people can't see images or menus online, and rely on alt-text, and people with hearing or audio processing issues need subtitles for audio-visual media. Color blind people often struggle with bad color design. 

By the way, check out this website: [Paletton](https://paletton.com) where you can choose a color scheme with accessibility in mind.

However, much like how there's not elevators everywhere, a lot of the digital world is inaccessible too.

## Not Bionic Reading

One other disadvantage that I and many other people struggle with is having difficulty reading. While it is not the same as dyslexia, I often find myself reading the same sections again and again, or struggle with finding the motivation to keep reading something that isn't engaging.

Now you're probably wondering about the title of today's entry. What is bionic reading? Well, it is a method designed for neurodivergent people, people with difficulty reading, people with dyslexia, etc. 

**Th**e **met**hod **cons**ists **o**f **bold**ing **o**r **highli**ghting **th**e **begin**nings **o**f **wor**ds. 

Like so. It doesn't work the same for everyone, but for some, it's reported that people read twice as fast, or have less difficulties processing the information that they're reading. Some, on the other hand, are distracted by this and report feeling better reading unhighlighted text. I do wonder what this would look like in other language, specifically Japanese since it doesn't use any spaces.

Personally, it felt like I could glide through words without much effort, so I'll definitely will be using this tool in the future.

However... the original creators of Bionic Reading have made the license to their tool so expensive that it's prohibitive and of course... not accessible.

So let me introduce you to... [**"Not Bionic Reading"**](https://not-br.neocities.org/), which is an open-source endeavor to make this method available to everyone.

Go ahead and test it and see if it makes it easier for you to read long documents!

## Accessibility in the workplace

Is your workplace accessible to everyone? Can you think of something that isn't really usable by some people? 

Specifically for engineering and desk jobs, a lot of the time we make ourselves suffer without thinking. 

One thing that I personally can't stand is ... sitting down! Or standing up. In my previous jobs or time in my school, I often had issues with standing for long periods of time, or with sitting for long periods of time. I have these issues both because of my knee and lower back problems, but also because my ADHD means I need to be engaged to be able to focus.

I think changing between standing and sitting, perhaps with a convertible standing desk, is better at least for me. Of course, it's always better to have an option available. Ergonomic keyboards or mice, perhaps could also be part of accessibility. 

Other kinds of workplace accessibility could also include the height of chairs. Lots of meeting rooms, restaurants or waiting rooms I've been in have this problem. All the chairs are incredibly low, and as someone with hip and knee problems, it usually hurts to sit on them. Now, who would want to go to a restaurant where the sitting is uncomfortable? It could lose them customers. When I'm in waiting rooms at hospitals or so I usually feel like I have no other option. I've been in meetings where I am so uncomfortable that it's near impossible to pay attention. Is the commute accessible? I've certainly seen too many metro stations without elevators, so even if the workplace would be accessible, how would someone with mobility issues get there?

I don't have all the answers of course, but I definitely think it's worth it to think about making the world a better place to live. Is your workplace physically accessible? Is the company website accessible? We need to start thinking more about these things.
