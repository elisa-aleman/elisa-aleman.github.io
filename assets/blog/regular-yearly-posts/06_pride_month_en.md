June is the LGBT/GSRM 🏳️‍🌈 Pride month!
Did you know?
LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender)
GSRM (Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities)
If anyone wants to ask questions, if anyone feels like they don’t understand, feel free to ask me questions.

-------------------------
Basic knowledge:
The S in GSRM: Sexual orientation

￼ ： Homosexuality, the L and the G in LGBT, Lesbian and Gay is when you like people of the same sex. The flag is the same as the flag for all LGBT people, but more precisely it is used as the homosexual flag.
￼ ：Lesbian, when girls like girls. This is the new flag, since the person that made the previous one said bad things about trans people. Some people also use this flag to mean “Liking other people that aren’t men”. It really depends on who you ask, and people use these flags differently.
￼ ：Bisexuality, when you like two or more genders, and this is it’s flag.
￼ ：Asexuality, when you don’t have any sexual preference for any genders, and it’s flag.
￼ ：Pansexual, when you like a person regardless of their gender, and it’s flag.


The G in GSRM: Gender identity
￼：Transgender, when you identify as a gender that wasn’t the one assigned to you at birth, and it’s flag.
￼：Non-binary, when you identify neither as a man or a woman, but something in between or something completely different, this is it’s flag.
￼ ：Agender, when you don’t identify with any gender whatsoever, not even the non-binary ones. This is it’s flag.


The R in GSRM: Romantic orientation
This part doesn’t have as many specific flags as the rest, but it deserves explanation.
Most of the time, people have the same sexual and romantic orientations. That is, if someone says “I like girls”, they might mean they like them sexually and also romantically fall in love with them. But in reality, these two can be different.
For example:
    An asexual person ￼ could not like any genders sexually but they could fall in love with people of a specific gender, or of any gender, if they are so inclined.
    Another example is someone who likes the opposite sex sexually (Heterosexual), but that romantically they only fall in love with the same sex ￼
There are many examples
Heteroromantic, likes the opposite gender romantically
Homoromantic, likes the same gender romantically
Biromantic, likes both or other genders romantically
Panromantic, likes people romantically regardless of their gender
Aromantic, doesn’t like any people romantically.

It doesn’t quite fit into the letters of GSRM but, there is one more to mention. In today’s society, it’s the norm to only have one partner. However, there are understanding, consenting relationships where people have more partners, or even 3 people or more in a single relationship. This is called Polyamory ￼ . It comes from the latin for many loves. However, getting into this one gets a bit complicated so let’s leave it at that for now.

Did everyone learn anything new?
It’s not important to remember all the flags, but to live in harmony and recognize that there’s many kinds of people, but that we are all humans. Let’s all walk into this world full of diversity together!

There are many combinations that can happen with gender identity, sexual orientation and romantic orientation,
and I really wanted to show you how diverse people can be.
If you have any questions beyond this please feel free to ask.

So, let’s talk about why June is the Pride month ￼ .

I’m sure you all know by now, but there’s protests and riots happening in USA because of the discrimination of black people and the murder of a black man, George Floyd, by the police during an arrest.

So, actually in June 28 1969, there was something called the Stonewall riots, and that’s why Pride is done on June.

At that time, there was a very strong anti-gay climate in USA. LGBT people would be discriminated, banned from shops, and so on. Actually they had no place to go but illegal bars owned by the mafia, which welcomed the people that had nowhere else to go. A bar called Stonewall Inn owned by the mafia was one of those places, and LGBT people would gather there. But there were many raids and arrests by police to those places. Innocent LGBT people would get crushed on the ground and arrested or killed for no other reason than being LGBT. So there was a reaction.

A black trans woman threw the first brick, and so the riot started.

Lots of things happened, and the riot ended, but as a result, at last were LGBT rights starting to appear.

So what I want everyone to reflect this month is how our human rights have always come from people’s deaths and sacrifice.
